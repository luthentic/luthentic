I have a passion for problem-solving and pioneering first-principle thinking, driven by purpose and fueled by the challenge of finding solutions, with a strong foundation in JavaScript, C#, Nodejs, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, React, Azure, etc. 

I'm an explorer of new tech, an avid learner, and a problem-solver at heart. When I'm not in code, you'll find me watching tech-related YouTube videos, fueling my curiosity.

Feel free to connect with me swlee5523@gmail.com for all things tech or just to say hello!
